### Hey there! 👋

Welcome to my corner of GitHub! Here's what's keeping me busy lately:

- 🔭 I'm diving into the world of coding practice platforms with a twist! Currently, I'm building one based on an adaptive learning system. It not only checks and corrects code but also tailors the learning experience by offering more questions from the same category, adapting to the user's needs.

- 🌱 Besides, I'm on a learning spree! Exploring the realms of machine learning has been captivating, and I'm channeling this newfound knowledge into a project on a recipe rating system. Oh, and I'm also sharpening my skills in Flask as I work on both the adaptive learning system and a library management system.

Exciting times ahead! Let's connect and share our coding adventures! 🚀👩‍💻
